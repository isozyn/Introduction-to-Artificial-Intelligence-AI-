**Week 1**



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Introduction**
AI - Augmented inteligence 
Discuss types of AI based on strength 

**What is AI**

- Simulates human intelligence through computer systems
- Utilizes algoruthms and data to function
- Enables machines to perform tasks requiring human intelligence
    - Learning
    - Reasoning
    - Problem solving
    - Decision-making


**How does AI learn?**
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reiforcement learning
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Artificial Intelligence vs. Augmented Intelligence**

Human Intelligence - Intelligence of humans
Artificial Intelligence - Intelligence of machines and can perform tasks on its owm.
Augmented Intellingence - A bit of both, Human intelligence with the help of AI


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Introducing Generative AI and Its Use Cases**

Generative IA creates new content 
Uses deep learning techniques and relies on vast data sets
Can use LLMs to do certain tasks such as decision-making and problem solving
  
Large Language Models (LLMs)
Perform natural language processing tasks:
  - Text generation
  - Translation
  - Summarization

Offers diverse content creation capabilities 
Enables human-like conversations
Generates training data through data augmentation 

Marketing use case
- Personalized advertisements
- Email campaigns
- Social media posts

Creative use case
- Digital art
- Music
- Video
- Audio

Product development use case
- Trend analysis
- Product idea generation
- Product design optimization

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Different types of AI**

Diagnostic/descriptive AI
- Focuses on the correctness of behaiviour.
- Looks at what happened and why.
- Identigies patterns and trends, performing comparative analyses and conducting a root cause analyses

Predictive AI
- Forecasting future treands based on historical and current data.
- Usually used to predict customer behaivior, market trends and other forward-looking insights

Presriptive AI
- Determines optimal course of action by providing recomendations based on data analysis
- goes beyond prediction by giving suggestions to help achieve desired outcomes

Generative/cognitive AI
- Produces various types of conent such as code, articles, images, and more.
- Mimics human creativity and cognitive processes to automate and assist conent creation

Reactive AI
- Responds to specific inputs with predetermined responses.
- Has no memory or abality to learn from past experiences

Limited memory AI
- Uses past experiences to inform current decisions.
- Learn from historical data to improve performance over time.

Theory of Mind AI
- Aims to understand human emotion, beliefs, and intentions.
- Still in research stage and seeks to interact more naturally with humans by comprehending their mental state.

Self-aware Ai
- Most advance form of AI.
- Has its own consciousness and self-awareness.
- Can understand and react to its own emotions and states.
- Only a theoritical concept.

Narrow AI (Weak AI)
- Performs a specific task or limited range of tasks.
- Excels in a single area but lacks generalization capabilities.
- Most current AI fall under this category

General AI (Strong AI)
- Can undersstand, learn, and apply knowledge accross a wide ranfe of tasks.
- It can also transfer knowledge from one domain to another and adapt autonomously.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Evolution of AI: Traditional AI vs. Generative AI**

 Traditional AI Framework
 - Data stored in repository
 - Analytics platform precesses this data to build predictive models.

Generative AI Framework
- Starts with vast amounts of data from various sources.
- Prompting and tuning these models to business specific needs for relevant insights.

Feedback loop where the models make them AI

**Artificial Intelligence - Are We There Yet?**

AI is defined as the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers, but true AGI, which would match human intelligence, has not yet been achieved.
