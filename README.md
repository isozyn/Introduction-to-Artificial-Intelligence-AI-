______________________________________________________________________________________

**Week 1**



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Introduction**
AI - Augmented inteligence 
Discuss types of AI based on strength 

**What is AI**

- Simulates human intelligence through computer systems
- Utilizes algoruthms and data to function
- Enables machines to perform tasks requiring human intelligence
    - Learning
    - Reasoning
    - Problem solving
    - Decision-making


**How does AI learn?**
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reiforcement learning
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Artificial Intelligence vs. Augmented Intelligence**

Human Intelligence - Intelligence of humans
Artificial Intelligence - Intelligence of machines and can perform tasks on its owm.
Augmented Intellingence - A bit of both, Human intelligence with the help of AI


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Introducing Generative AI and Its Use Cases**

Generative IA creates new content 
Uses deep learning techniques and relies on vast data sets
Can use LLMs to do certain tasks such as decision-making and problem solving
  
Large Language Models (LLMs)
Perform natural language processing tasks:
  - Text generation
  - Translation
  - Summarization

Offers diverse content creation capabilities 
Enables human-like conversations
Generates training data through data augmentation 

Marketing use case
- Personalized advertisements
- Email campaigns
- Social media posts

Creative use case
- Digital art
- Music
- Video
- Audio

Product development use case
- Trend analysis
- Product idea generation
- Product design optimization

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Different types of AI**

Diagnostic/descriptive AI
- Focuses on the correctness of behaiviour.
- Looks at what happened and why.
- Identigies patterns and trends, performing comparative analyses and conducting a root cause analyses

Predictive AI
- Forecasting future treands based on historical and current data.
- Usually used to predict customer behaivior, market trends and other forward-looking insights

Presriptive AI
- Determines optimal course of action by providing recomendations based on data analysis
- goes beyond prediction by giving suggestions to help achieve desired outcomes

Generative/cognitive AI
- Produces various types of conent such as code, articles, images, and more.
- Mimics human creativity and cognitive processes to automate and assist conent creation

Reactive AI
- Responds to specific inputs with predetermined responses.
- Has no memory or abality to learn from past experiences

Limited memory AI
- Uses past experiences to inform current decisions.
- Learn from historical data to improve performance over time.

Theory of Mind AI
- Aims to understand human emotion, beliefs, and intentions.
- Still in research stage and seeks to interact more naturally with humans by comprehending their mental state.

Self-aware Ai
- Most advance form of AI.
- Has its own consciousness and self-awareness.
- Can understand and react to its own emotions and states.
- Only a theoritical concept.

Narrow AI (Weak AI)
- Performs a specific task or limited range of tasks.
- Excels in a single area but lacks generalization capabilities.
- Most current AI fall under this category

General AI (Strong AI)
- Can undersstand, learn, and apply knowledge accross a wide ranfe of tasks.
- It can also transfer knowledge from one domain to another and adapt autonomously.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Evolution of AI: Traditional AI vs. Generative AI**

 Traditional AI Framework
 - Data stored in repository
 - Analytics platform precesses this data to build predictive models.

Generative AI Framework
- Starts with vast amounts of data from various sources.
- Prompting and tuning these models to business specific needs for relevant insights.

Feedback loop where the models make them AI

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Artificial Intelligence - Are We There Yet?**

AI is defined as the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers, but true AGI, which would match human intelligence, has not yet been achieved.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**AI in Daily Life**

AI enables efficiency and convinience by optimizing tasks and improving functionality.

- Virtual assistants
    - Siri
    - Google assistant
    - Alexa
- Smart home
    - Thermostats
    - Lights
    - Security camera

Uses recomendation systems do analyise large amounts of data to provide personalised recomendations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**AI Chatbots and Smart Assistants**

What is an AI chatbot?
- Understands and responds to queries
- Provide information
- Perform tasks
- Uses advance algorithms and NLP techniques
- Simulate human-like conversations

Evolution of AI chatbots
From: Rule-based systems ( Predefinied rules and patters)
To: AI chatbots (Capable of complete conversations)

Generative AI models
- Context-based conversations
- Personalized recomendations

How do AI chatbots work?
- Information database
- Deep learning
- Machine learning
- NlP 

1. Analyzes input
2. Uses Ai algorithms and NLP
3. Dialogue management system (Selects correct response). + Machine learning algoithm (update chatbot's knowledge base)
4. Generates response

Benifits of AI chatbots
- All-time availablity
- Scalability
- Personalized services and suggestions
- Natural conversations
- Multilingual communications

Future of AI chatbots
- Reshape business communication
- Focus on more human-like chatbots
- Use of sintiment analysis
- Enhance work efficiency
- Automate tasks

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is a Chatbot?**

Chatbots utilize natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence to understand and respond to users.

Chatbots operate in the cloud and connect to databases to check product availability or to process orders.

They automate tasks to allow businesses to focus on their primary responsibilities.

Beifits of chatbot
- Save time for both customer and business by streamlining interactions
- simple to build and can be launched quickly even without coding knowledge
